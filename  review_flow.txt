create a new review flow: 
1. FE sends username password and review.
2. BE fetches user with username:
	if no such user -> create one. -> create review -> return "user created + review created"
	if has same password ->  create review -> return"review created"

	user exists, wrong password -> return "wrong password"

edit review:
1. FE sends username password and new review.
2. BE fetches user with username:
	if no such user -> return "error, no such user exists"
	if has same password ->  edit the review -> "success"

	user exists, wrong password -> return "wrong password"

delete review
1. FE sends username password and review id
2. BE fetches user with username:
	if no such user -> return "error, no such user exists"
	if has same password ->  delete the review -> "success"

	user exists, wrong password -> return "wrong password"


OR a separate create user page ???? difference would only be in creating a review - error on no such user.

create user: 
1. fetch user by username
2. if exists - error, else - create one.
